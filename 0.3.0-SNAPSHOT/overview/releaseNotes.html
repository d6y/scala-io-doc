The major changes are:
<ul>
	<li>Change CloseableIterator and LongTraversable to be specialized for byte so if the Function1 is specialized for byte the performance is drastically improved</li>
	<li>Change LongTraversable so that the traversable is always lazy and as a result removed the View parallel heirachy</li>
</ul>
