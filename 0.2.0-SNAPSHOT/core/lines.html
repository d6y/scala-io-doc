    <div class="example_summary"><span><span>  <p> Both Input and ReadChars objects have a method traversing the object one line at a time.  The terminator can be autodetected (which assumes the ending is one of \n, \r\n, \r) or it can be explicitely declared, or it can be a custom separator such as <em>';'</em>.  </p><p> Note: The <em>lines()</em> method is lazily evaluated so calling the method without processing will not result in any processing of the resource</p> </span></span></div>
